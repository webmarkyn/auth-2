# PROJECT: FORMS from Microverse
From the Microverse Ruby on rails curriculum
Following [this link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication) from The Odin Project 

These projects will give you a chance to actually build some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides. The tutorial chapter will cover integrating a signup form with your Rails application and providing help if the user enters incorrect information.

In this project, youâ€™ll build a form the old fashioned way and then the Rails way.

## Installation
1. git clone url
2. cd auth
3. bundle install
4. rails server
